        <h4>What is encryption and how is it used to protect my information?</h4>
        Encryption is a method of scrambling your information to protect its transmission across the Internet.
        Encryption transforms data into an unreadable form, and decryption reverses that process. Both encryption and
        decryption require the use of a special code, usually referred to as 'encryption key'. The encryption of data
        provides a strong degree of protection against tampering while data is moving through the Internet.
        <br><br><br>

        <h4>What precautions should I take for this online banking support service?</h4>
        Besides maintaining the confidentiality of your Temporary ID and Temporary Password, you should take the
        following precautions:
        <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
          <li>Clear your browser's cache on a regular basis so that your account information is removed. This is
            particularly important if you are using a shared PC. You should clear it after each session.</li>
          <li>Always use the latest recommended Internet browser so that you are using the most updated security
            features available.</li>
          <li>Call us at +65 7777 7777 immediately if you notice any unusual transactions on your account.</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>

        <h4>What should I do if I do not get a response after clicking on a hyperlink or icon?</h4>
        Sometimes, the Internet becomes unavoidably slow to respond. If there is a delay in response from when you have
        clicked something, please wait. Avoid clicking repeatedly on a particular link.
